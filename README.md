Research paper titled "Navigating the Quantum Frontier: A Study of Post-Quantum Cryptography in TLS Integration" LaTeX source files and CC licence.

This paper explores the integration of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) into Transport Layer Security (TLS) to mitigate the emerging threats posed by quantum computing. Highlighting the vulnerabilities of classical cryptography to quantum algorithms such as Shorâ€™s, it emphasizes the urgent need for quantum- resistant solutions. The study evaluates prominent PQC algorithms, including NIST finalists, focusing on their implementation in TLS through hybrid and purely post-quantum approaches. Additionally, the paper outlines future directions for PQC in TLS, including hybrid mechanisms, hardware optimizations, and adapting PQC for resource-constrained environments.
